# qb-incompressible-cfd-resource-estimates

JSON files containing resource estimate information for the flow-around-a-sphere problem at various Reynolds numbers (Re).

See https://3.basecamp.com/3613864/buckets/26823103/messages/6765123195 for a link to the "Incompressible CFD" white paper on Overleaf.

These follow the schema from https://github.com/rroodll/QB-Estimate-Reporting with a few extra fields of `timestamp`, `uuid`, and `comments`.  Only logical resource estimates were calculated for these problem instances.
